# Cherry-MX-Arcade-Button-Keycap

Basically 3d models of an arcade pushbutton for cherry mx/cherry mx clone switches that you can print using a 3d printer

for now only 30mm push button keycaps are here (I'd gladly buy some if I could get 10 prints of these cheap enough)

Feel free to use and set up to sell these as prints
